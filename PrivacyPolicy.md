## Privacy Policy

Harshad Jadav built the Face Mask app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by Harshad Jadav at free cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Face Mask unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Introduction**
FaceMask Studio (“the App”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information—including face data—is handled.
The App performs all image processing locally on your device. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive data.

**Information We Do NOT Collect**
The App does not collect:
	•	Face data
	•	Photos, images, or videos
	•	Biometric identifiers
	•	Facial recognition data
	•	Contact information
	•	Location data
	•	Device identifiers
	•	Advertising ID (IDFA)
	•	Analytics or usage data
Your photos—and all face detection results—remain only on your device.

**Information We DO Collect**
We collect nothing.
All photo editing, face detection, and processing is performed on-device in temporary memory only. No data is stored or transmitted.

**How Your Photos and Face Data Are Used**
The App uses Apple’s Vision framework to detect faces only to help position emoji masks and stickers for editing.
Face data is:
	•	Processed only on-device
	•	Used only to detect face position and angle
	•	Discarded immediately after processing
	•	Never saved, stored, uploaded, or shared
	•	Never linked to identity
	•	Never used for facial recognition
The App does not create or store any biometric identifiers.
No face data leaves the user's device at any time.

**Third-Party Services**
The App uses only Apple system frameworks such as:
	•	Vision
	•	Core Image
	•	SwiftUI
These frameworks operate entirely on your device. No third-party SDKs, analytics, or servers are used.

**Face Data Retention**
Face detection rectangles and landmarks:
	•	Are held temporarily in memory (RAM)
	•	Are deleted immediately after use
	•	Are not written to disk
	•	Are not retained once the user finishes editing
Retention time: Only for the duration of the editing session.

**Data Security**
Because the App does not collect or transmit data, there is:
	•	No server storage
	•	No cloud upload
	•	No risk of leakage
	•	No persistent storage of any user data
All processing occurs locally.

**Children’s Privacy**
The App collects no personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
